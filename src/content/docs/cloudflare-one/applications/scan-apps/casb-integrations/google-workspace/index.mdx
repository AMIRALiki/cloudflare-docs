## Integration prerequisites

<Render file="casb/google-prereqs" />

## Integration permissions

For the Google Workspace integration to function, Cloudflare CASB requires the following Google API permissions:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.domain.readonly`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.security`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform.read-only`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.basic`

These permissions follow the principle of least privilege to ensure that only the minimum required access is granted. To learn more about each permission, refer to the [Google Workspace Admin SDK Directory API](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/authorizing).
